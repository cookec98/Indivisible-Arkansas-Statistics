# Team Contract

A **Team Contract** is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own &quot;rules of engagement&quot; through development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed BEFORE starting the actual course project. **For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule.**** Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records.** This document is more for your group than it is for me so feel free to tailor it to your group&#39;s needs.

**F. Description of Each Members' Roles:**
  1. Josh Thomeczek -- My first responsibility, and the one I've already acted on, is client communication. I want to make sure we stay on topic and create something useful and understandable to our client. Second, I am responsible for the front-end HTML and CSS - that is, what the client will interact with. These two things go hand in hand, so I thought it would be best to combine them with one person. The organization of our team is highly democratic, so it's up to all of us to organize when needed. Finally, it's important that we all remain flexible, and I will assist the other members when needed.
  3. Jacob Newland -- While my roles are framework and development, I recognize that I will be working on whichever parts of this project that I'm able to and am available for after some discussion with my teammates.  Framework is the initial plan and decisions about what this will look like, its useage, and the user experience on the site.  I intend to do this with the help of LucidChart, Vertabelo, and Trello, along with any other software useful in this front and anything I write or draw.  Deployment will entail all steps require to make our site accessible to Indivisible Arkansas and their users.  I intend to do this through the release of updates and patches for Indivisible Arkansas to see throughout our development process so that they may comment on what they like/dislike and what we could change before our final release.  With the help of my teammates, we will leave our client completely satisfied with our site by our final deadline.  I will also ensure that I help any of my teammates with any issue on this project in any way I can.
  4.   4. Campbell Cooke -- This project of course will be collaborative on all fronts, so while my specific role is Front-end Javascript / AJAX, I will always talk to and with my other team members about proposed changes or actions needed to be taken on the website. I will have the responsibility of ensuring the Javascript that runs the background of the website
  is always functional and allows our client to easily access the information they need from the database and that the data that does get taken from the database is presented in a
  nice and easy to read way. I will also take responsibility for some of the Team Organization, and I just didn't put that explicitly under my roles in the team because the idea is
  for all of the Organization to be highly agreed upon by all members of the team rather than having just one person decide things.
  5. Maxwell Gilbreath --  My responsibilities in the SQL Schema Design will require me to design and implement a database in SQL that can adequately serve the purposes of the project that require the usage of such systems. I will work to provide satisfactory results in this endevor, as well as maintaining a clean and well-documented codebase so that further development may take place even after the project is over by other devlopers with ease and little confusion. I will work to coordinate with my team members to ensure that not only I don't fall behind, but to assist in areas that may require more than one contributor. I will ensure that any and all delays/setbacks are clearly communicated with my team so that they are swiftly dealt with and work may resume in a timely manner.
